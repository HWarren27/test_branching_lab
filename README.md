# test_branching_lab
This lab focuses on mastering collaborative Git workflows rather than writing complex code: working together as a team to build a straightforward Python console app, prioritizing branch management, peer collaboration, and clean merge integration.

---

Workflow priorities were as follows:
1) Branching Discipline: Using feature branches correctly instead of committing directly to the main line.
2) Collaboration: Managing shared code and resolving overlaps with teammates.
3) Integration: Practicing Pull Requests (PRs) and ensuring the final merge is functional.
